My name is Wei-Yao Wang (王威堯 in Chinese). I am a research scientist at Sony, working on **foundation models**. I received my Ph.D. and BSc degrees from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan respectively, advised by [Prof. Wen-Chih Peng](https://sites.google.com/site/wcpeng/wcpeng). During his academic journey, Dr. Wang served as a visiting researcher at the ScAi lab advised by [Prof. Wei Wang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/) at the University of California, Los Angeles.

My research intersts include Large Foundation Models, Natural Language Processing, Sport Science, and Representation Learning, which has been published more than 20 papers in international journals and major peer-reviewed conference proceedings, including multiple best paper awards.
