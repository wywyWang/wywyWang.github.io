My name is Wei-Yao Wang (王威堯 in Chinese). I am a research scientist at Sony, working on **multimodal foundation models**. I received my Ph.D. and BSc degrees from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan respectively, advised by [Prof. Wen-Chih Peng](https://sites.google.com/site/wcpeng/wcpeng). During his academic journey, Dr. Wang served as a visiting researcher at the ScAi lab advised by [Prof. Wei Wang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/) at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was a research intern at [Document AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/document-ai/overview/) in Microsoft in Seattle and Microsoft AI R&D Center in Taipei advised by [Paul Hsu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/paulhsu/), working on **low-resource field extractions from multi-modal documents with LLMs**.

My research intersts include Large Foundation Models, Natural Language Processing, Sport Science, and Representation Learning, which has been published more than 30 papers in international journals and major peer-reviewed conference proceedings, including multiple best paper awards. I serve on the program committees of international conferences including ICLR, AAAI, ACL ARR, KDD, IJCAI, CIKM, and PAKDD and workshop organizers ([IT4PSS 23-24](https://wasn.csie.ncu.edu.tw/workshop/IT4PSS2024.html), [SocialNLP 22](https://sites.google.com/view/socialnlp2022/)).

For more information, please visit my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YWwWkMy9zy4jGmm8Jni4zRh-iomogupX/view?usp=drive_link). I am also open to research collaboration. Please drop me an email if you are interested in.
